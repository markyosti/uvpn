- lzh compression - so we can test that our buffer and
  encoding / decoding primitives are adeguate.

- http / raw socket transcoder, so we can 1) test that
  again the API is ok for something fancier, and we can
  have something to show off.

- timer / error handling, really important if we want
  anyone to really use this.

- multi transcoder support, so we can really get this
  to automatically try and pick multiple methods, and
  we can test that it works as expected.

- SrpClient and SrpServer, bn_ctx_ should be shared
  with SrpSecret. Right now, Secret and Client and/or
  Server have a different bn_ctx_.

- SrpClient, and SrpServer, should make sure that bn_ctx_
  and temporary big numbers are:
    1) overwritten securely, so they're not left hanging
       around in memory.
    2) freed, as soon as they are not needed anymore.
       This is especially important for the server, as
       failure to do so will mean a few more kb of memory
       *per client*.
